    <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly associated with France.
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered
        yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
        rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
        similar to a puff pastry.
